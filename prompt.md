I'm building a modern web tool for hiring needs – primarily for small businesses and lean teams. The product helps them post jobs, manage applicants, and streamline hiring without bloated HR tools.

Here's my current website: [https://hire.vaayulabs.xyz/](https://hire.vaayulabs.xyz/)

I want you to **redesign the full website UI** with a clean, modern, minimal design language, optimized for **mobile and desktop**, keeping accessibility and SEO in mind.

Design goals:

* Use a modular layout with consistent, reusable components.
* Keep sections visually balanced, with clean typography, spacing, and contrast.
* Align with **Web3-inspired UI** (neumorphism or soft gradients, clean edges, rounded corners, glowing CTAs, subtle animations).
* Typography: prioritize **Montserrat**, **Poppins**, or **Nunito** for a fresh and approachable feel.
* Use a consistent color palette (e.g. soft purples, muted darks, or pastel gradients) – NOT generic blue.
* Make every element responsive and mobile-first.
* Optimize images and illustrations (no pixelation, use SVGs or crisp modern styles).
* Each card, form, and button should be smartly structured, consistent in padding, border-radius, and hierarchy.

Pages to include in redesign:

* Hero/Landing page (clear CTA + short pitch)
* How it works / Features (3-step layout or card format)
* Pricing Section (modular, toggle view if needed)
* Job Board or Dashboard demo (mocked UI section)
* Testimonials or Trust Logos (if available)
* Footer (legal links, socials, contact)

Be mindful of:

* SEO-optimized layout structure (H1-H3 hierarchy, fast loading, semantic HTML)
* Smooth scroll or minimal interaction elements that feel snappy
* Minimal use of external libraries (tailwind preferred if CSS-based)

Now give me the **redesigned structure** with:

1. Layout plan per section
2. Components list (Hero, CTA, Cards, Testimonials etc.)
3. Visual direction (colors, fonts, spacing, imagery)
4. Responsive rules and mobile adaptations
5. Bonus: suggestions for animations or transitions to add life

Treat this like a creative brief for a full redesign. Assume you're helping a solo founder impress modern teams & small startups.
